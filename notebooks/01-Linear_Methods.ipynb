    "Once a generic, mathematically flexible model has been chosen, the empirical association between inputs and targets is taken as the only basis to establish an _inductive_ relationship between them: we only look at what the data tells to be a strong correlation, neither reasoning on causal links, nor attempting to develop a simple, coherent, or elegant theory.\n",

On the risks of purely inductive reasoning, see [Bertrand Russel's inductivist chicken story](http://www.ditext.com/russell/rus6.html). \n",

    "In practice, _inductive biases_ are often included in the modeling, by means of the choices that are made in the construction and the tuning of the model itself: this is how a component of physics-inspired (deductive) concepts can make it back into machine learning. "

    "The tendency of achieving a very low loss on the train set and a much larger test set error is a general phenomenon known as [_overfitting_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting). Overfitting is usually particularly bad when the train set size siginficant smalller than the number of model parameters. Polynomial regression with a high degree is notorious for overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common strategy to avoid overfitting is known as _regularization_. In broad terms, regularization implies penalizing solutions of the model that are too rapidly varying, and favouring those that are smoother, even at the cost of a slight increase of the train set error. In linear regression, the most common approach for linear models is to introduce a penalty term on the variance of the model. The variance of a linear model is determined by the parameter space the weights can span. Therefore a penalty term on the norm of the weights is added to the loss function. The most popular case of the $L^2$-norm is referred to as the [Tikhonov regularization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikhonov_regularization). In this case the loss function is extended by a $L^2$ penalty on the weights.\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The model corresponding to this loss function is referred to as $L^2$-regularized least-squares estimator or ridge regression. The $L^2$-regularization is the most popular approach, because it yields a closed-form solution for the weights \n",

    "\n",
    "and can therefore be efficiently computed. Alternative choices of norm, both in the error and in the regularization, may lead to desirable behaviors. For example the $L^1$ norm, referred to as [Lasso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasso_(statistics)), is typically used to obtain a _sparse_ weight matrix, i.e. a matrix in which many terms are vanishingly small."

The problem can be formulated in different terms: as the identification of the directions with maximum variance in feature space, as the maximisation of the variance retained in the latent space, or as the low-rank orthogonal projection of the feature matrix that minimizes the information loss. \n",

    "The projector $\\mathbf{P}_{XT}$ can be built using a [singular value decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition) of $\\mathbf{X}$ or, equivalently, by computing the eigenvalue decomposition of the covariance matrix $\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X}$.
